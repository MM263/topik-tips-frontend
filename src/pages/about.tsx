      <p>Hello! My name is Olga and I teach Korean language.</p>
      <p>
        During my time as a teacher, I've created a lot of materials for my
        students to help them to prepare for the TOPIK exam. I believe that
        sharing the work that I have accumulated over the years would help
        everyone who wants to get great score on TOPIK. My husband and I created
        Topik Tips to post information on the structure of the exam,
        time-efficient methods for solving the tasks, vocabulary and grammar
        exercises made in the format of the exam, as well as other materials
        that can help in the preparation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, if you are applying to Korean universities you can find
        language materials to help you to prepare for you future education in
        Korea.
      </p>
      <p>We hope that our site will help you pass the TOPIK successfully! </p>
