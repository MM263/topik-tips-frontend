If you plan to sit the TOPIK II exam or already registered for it, it is essential for you to understand the exam structure. Here I will try not to present very wide-spread information about the time when the exam starts and so on that is available almost in every TOPIK-related website (if you want to check it, please visit <https://topik.go.kr/usr/cmm/subLocation.do?menuSeq=2210101>). Instead, I want to give you some tips on how to work efficiently within the TOPIK II structure and tight time limits. So, let's start!

1. Now TOPIK II has three sections: Listening, Writing, and Reading. Listening and writing are in the first part of the exam and Reading is in the second part of the exam. To solve the first part you have 1 hour 30 minutes and to solve the second part you have 70 minutes. And here is a thing: to be honest, I consider this amount of time not enough for this kind of test, and I am not the only one who thinks so. In particular, from my own experience Listening and Reading sections may seem rough when you are on a 3-4급, but students with 5-6급 usually can solve it in time. The problem is usually with Writing. You have 40 minutes to solve two small tasks, write a description for a diagram and write an essay. I know many people who know Korean perfectly and who work as Korean translators who weren't able to finish the last essay in time (all of them still got 6급 though). 

   I am telling this to you not to show how difficult the TOPIK II is but to highlight the importance of time management during the exam. Therefore, my first advice is to always practice with a timer, especially with Writing and Reading tasks. First, when you start to practice with the past TOPIK tests, track the time you spend to complete the tasks but do not hurry. Then, compare the time you spent with the exam time limits. If you spent more time than supposed to, try to gradually increase the pace of completing tasks in order to manage to do as many tasks as you want to complete in order to get your desired 급. I always tell my students that if your goal is 3-4 급, it is better to manage to do 30-35 tasks and do them thoughtfully, than be in a hurry to complete all 50. Of course, if your goal is 5-6 급 you should try to complete all the tasks in time.
2. My second piece of advice is also related to time management during the test and is mostly for those whose goal is 3-4 급. If you know that the last six or ten tasks of the Listening part are still too hard for you, consider skipping these tasks to spend this time on Writing. Since both parts are during the first part of the exam, you can start the Writing tasks even if the Listening part has not finished. By doing so, you can spend more time on the tasks that you most likely can complete successfully. Again, if your goal is 5-6 급 you should try to complete all the tasks.
3. My third piece of advice is to track in what types of tasks you do mistakes more often than in others. For example, after completing 3-4 practice tests compare your mistakes. Are there tasks in which you made mistakes in several tests in a row? If there are, that means that you should analyze your mistakes in this task more carefully, and pay more attention to this type of task.\
   To illustrate, if you have compared your mistakes in four practice tests and realized that you had mistakes in 17-20 Listening tasks, try to identify why it happened. Ask yourself:

* Do I understand the task correctly?
* Do I concentrate on an important information/speaker?

  Then, if you practice with special TOPIK preparation books, read the explanation for this task provided by the authors. Usually, these books highlight the information provided in the Listening or Reading task that was important to identify the correct answer. Have you mentioned it? If you excluded the correct answer, why you did it?\
  In other words, analyze your mistakes, especially if they appeared in the same tasks.

4. When you're learning new vocabulary, always try to remember if there are the words with the same or close meaning that you already know. That is an important self-check because often answers contain paraphrased sentences from the text where some words replaced with their synonyms. Therefore, by trying to keep all the words with the same meaning in mind you can avoid situations when you do not sure if this is the word with the same meaning or not. 

5. The last advice is to do not forget about common-sense. If you see an absolutely absurd answer, it means that it's most probably the incorrect answer. For example, "Owls sleep at night". We know that owls do not sleep at night and hunt, so it is very unlikely for the listening or reading task to claim this. ( Be careful: cases like "The man thinks that owls sleep at night" are not included!)

Good luck!
